//  Design a class called Date. The class should store a date in three integers: month, day,
//  and year. There should be member functions to print the date in the following forms:
//
//      12/25/2018
//      December 25, 2018
//      25 December 2018
//
//  Demonstrate the class by writing a complete program implementing it.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept values for the day greater than 31 or less than 1. Do
//  not accept values for the month greater than 12 or less than 1.
